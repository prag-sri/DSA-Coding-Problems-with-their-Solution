                                         ********************** Rectangle Area *********************

LeetCode Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/
                               
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

 

Example 1:

Rectangle Area
Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
Output: 45
Example 2:

Input: ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2
Output: 16
 

Constraints:

-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104
-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104
-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104
-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104

class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {    
        //STEPS FOR SOLUTION:-
        //1)The total area covered by the two rectangles has to be found i.e. Area of Rectangle1+ Area of Rectangle2- Area of Intersecting Rectangles (if area of intersecting rectangles is not subtracted then it will be added twice)
        //2)Calculating Area of Rectangle1= Add x1 and x2 coordinates and y1 and y2 coordinates then multiply x and y to get the area
        //3)Calculating Area of Rectangle2= Add x1 and x2 coordinates and y1 and y2 coordinates then multiply x and y to get the area
        //4)Calculating Area of Intersecting Rectangles= Calculate min of coordinates of 2nd and 4th quadrants(negative coordinates) - Calculate max of coordinates of 1st and 3rd quadrants(positive coordinates)- adding all x axis coordinates and y axis coordinates- then multiply x and y to get the area
        //5)If either of x or y axis is negative then that means the rectangle will never intersect then take the area of intersecting rectangle as 0
        //5)Return the value= Area of Rectangle1+ Area of Rectangle2- Area of Intersecting Rectangles
        
        int a1= (ax2-ax1)*(ay2-ay1);
        int a2= (bx2-bx1)*(by2-by1);
        
        int cx1= Math.max(ax1,bx1);
        int cy1= Math.max(ay1,by1);
        int cx2= Math.min(ax2,bx2);
        int cy2= Math.min(ay2,by2);
        
        int x= (cx2-cx1);
        int y= (cy2-cy1);
        int a3= x*y;
        if(x<0 || y<0)
            a3=0;
